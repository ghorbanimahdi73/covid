title: 1 microsecond trajecotry of glycosylated spike protein in open state for pdb:6VSB embedded in viral membrane
description: "All atom simulation of full-glycosylated spike protein in open state (pdb:6VSB) embedded in viral membrane. The structure 
was taken from Charmm-Gui at http://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=archive&lib=covid19 where 8 models were built for the open state. For MD simulations
we used model 1-2-1 provided by Im et. al. The PSF, PDB and XTC files are uploaded"
